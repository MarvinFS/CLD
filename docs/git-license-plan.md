  It looks like when I tried to create this file earlier, the content filtering blocked it due to your name in the copyright notice. This is a    
  false positive from the API's content filtering system - it's not related to anything you did wrong.

  To proceed, you have a few options:

  1. Create the file manually using the plan above
  2. I can create a template with a placeholder like [COPYRIGHT_HOLDER] that you replace
  3. Try again with a slightly different format

  Which would you prefer?
